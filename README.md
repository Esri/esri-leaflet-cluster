# Esri Leaflet Clustered Feature Layer

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/Esri/esri-leaflet-clustered-feature-layer.svg)](https://travis-ci.org/Esri/esri-leaflet-clustered-feature-layer)

A plugin for Esri Leaflet that enables visualization of Feature Services as clusters using the [L.MarkerCluster](https://github.com/Leaflet/Leaflet.markercluster) Leaflet Plugin.

### Demos
A live demo is available on the [Esri Leaflet website](http://esri.github.io/esri-leaflet/examples/custering-feature-layers.html).

### Example
Here is a quick example to get you started. Just change the paths to point to the proper libraries and go.
